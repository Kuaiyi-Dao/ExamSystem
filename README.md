## how to add questions

you can find question in questions.txt, the main.py will load question from that file, so you can add questions by editing the questions.txt. To correctly add questions, you should follow the format, for example:

```
{"type":2,"des":'c语言很简单',"choice":["正确","错误"],"ans":'错误'}
```
